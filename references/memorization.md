## Overview

Memorization (hifz) is one of the most-requested Quran app categories. Effective hifz apps digitize a method that has worked for 14 centuries rather than inventing new pedagogy. Understand the traditional method first, then map features onto it.

## The Traditional Hifz Method

Hifz schools worldwide use a three-tier daily routine. Model your review system on it — users from traditional backgrounds expect these concepts:

| Tier | Arabic | What It Is | Typical Daily Amount |
|------|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **New lesson** | سبق (sabaq) | Verses being memorized today | ¼–1 page |
| **Recent revision** | سبقي (sabqi) | Last 7–30 days of memorization, still fragile | Last few pages |
| **Old revision** | منزل (manzil / muraja'ah) | Consolidated portions, reviewed on rotation | ½–1 juz |

**Key implications:**
- The **page** (of the 604-page Madinah mushaf) is the standard unit of memorization progress, not the ayah. Most huffaz think in pages and juz.
- New memorization without structured revision fails. An app that only tracks "memorized surahs" without a revision queue misses the hard part.
- Recently memorized material needs far more frequent review than old material — this maps naturally onto spaced repetition.

## Core Features

### Hide/reveal modes
- **Full mask:** Hide the ayah entirely; user recites from memory, then taps to reveal.
- **Progressive reveal:** Reveal word by word as the user recites (pairs well with verse recognition — see below).
- **First-word hint:** Show only the first word of each ayah as a prompt.
- **Mistake marking:** Let the user (or teacher) tap a word to mark a mistake; store it word-level for later drilling.

### Repeat loops (audio)
- Repeat a single ayah N times, then auto-advance (classic memorization drill: 3–10× per ayah).
- Loop a range (ayah 1–5 of a page) with configurable repetitions per ayah and per range.
- Adjustable playback speed. Gapless transitions matter — a pause between repeats breaks the drill rhythm.
- See [audio.md](audio.md) for ayah-level audio sources and playback patterns.

### Testing modes
- **Continue from here:** Show/play an ayah, user continues reciting the next ones.
- **Random spot check:** Random ayah from the user's memorized range — the standard oral exam format.
- **Page connections:** Prompt with the last ayah of a page, user recites the first ayah of the next page. Page transitions are a notorious weak point.
- **Where is this from?** Show an ayah, user identifies surah/juz — useful for advanced review.

### Progress & motivation
- Track by page and juz (primary), with surah view as secondary.
- Distinguish statuses: not started / in progress / memorized / needs review (see [data-models.md](data-models.md)).
- Streaks and daily goals work, but keep them humble in tone — this is worship, not a game. Avoid leaderboards ranking users by "Quran memorized."

## Spaced Repetition

SM-2/FSRS-style algorithms work well for hifz with adaptations:

- **The item is a page or ayah-range, not a flashcard.** Reviewing a page takes minutes, so the daily queue must respect a time budget (e.g., cap the queue at ~30 min of reciting), not just card counts.
- **Seed intervals from the sabaq/sabqi/manzil structure:** new material reviews daily for a week or more before intervals stretch; consolidated material can go weeks.
- **Grade by mistake count** from the review session (0 mistakes = easy, 1–2 = good, 3+ = again) instead of asking users to self-rate.
- **Never let intervals grow unbounded.** Even solid huffaz revise the whole Quran on a fixed rotation (e.g., a juz per day). Cap the maximum interval (e.g., 30–60 days).
- Word-level mistake history should raise the review frequency of the specific pages containing chronic mistake words.

## Mutashabihat (Similar Verses)

Nearly-identical verses in different surahs are the #1 source of memorization errors (e.g., the recurring آلاء passages, similar endings like غفور رحيم vs عزيز حكيم).

- **QUL** provides ~5,277 mutashabihat entries and ~4,001 similar-ayah pairs — use this data rather than computing similarity yourself.
- Show a "similar verses" warning on ayahs with known confusions, with a side-by-side diff highlighting the differing words.
- Build a dedicated drill mode: present the shared stem, user picks/recites the correct continuation for the current surah.
- When a recitation-checking feature detects the user drifting into the *other* similar verse, name that explicitly ("you continued into 23:86 instead of 17:102") — it's far more useful than "wrong word."

## Recitation Checking

Two levels of automated checking:

1. **Verse identification** — confirm the user recited the intended ayah(s). Use offline-tarteel (see [verse-recognition.md](verse-recognition.md)); it returns `{surah, ayah, ayah_end, score}` fully offline.
2. **Word-level following** — track position word by word for progressive reveal and mistake detection. Requires ASR (tarteel-ai/whisper-base-ar-quran) plus alignment; see [audio.md](audio.md). Expect errors on tajweed-heavy passages — surface low-confidence results as "check this word" rather than asserting a mistake.

**Do not claim tajweed evaluation** unless you genuinely implement it — current open ASR models cannot reliably judge tajweed correctness (see the warning in [audio.md](audio.md)). A false "your recitation is correct" is worse than no feedback. For serious hifz, position the app as a supplement to a teacher, not a replacement.

## Data Model

See [data-models.md](data-models.md) for the `Memorization Progress` entity. Extend it with:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| unit | enum | page / ayah_range / surah |
| ease / stability | float | Spaced-repetition scheduling state |
| next_review | datetime | When this unit is due |
| mistake_words | array | [{surah, ayah, word_position, count, last_at}] |
| tier | enum | sabaq / sabqi / manzil |

As always, include `mushaf_id` — page numbers and ayah boundaries are mushaf-specific.

## Best Practices

- **Default to the 604-page Madinah layout** for page-based tracking, but derive page boundaries from the active mushaf's metadata (Warsh mushafs paginate differently).
- **Review queue over library.** The home screen of a hifz app should answer "what do I review right now?", not show a surah list.
- **Offline is non-negotiable.** Memorization sessions happen in mosques and classrooms without connectivity. All drill modes and queues must work offline.
- **Support teacher/student workflows.** Many users memorize under a teacher: shared progress visibility, teacher-marked mistakes, and assignment of the next sabaq are high-value features.
- **Respect the adab rules** ([adab.md](adab.md)): masked/hidden text must never be rendered truncated mid-ayah when revealed, and test prompts must show complete ayahs.
- **Khatma tracking** (completing the full Quran in recitation) is a related but distinct feature — reading progress, not memorization state. Keep the two separate in the data model.
